### Blogs
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/) - Good for staying up to date on Swift.
* [iOS Dev Weekly](https://iosdevweekly.com/) - A weekly summary of new updates in the world of iOS. Has interesting articles and includes design choices and best practices.

### Tools
* [Swiftlint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) - Make sure no one commits ugly code to your project. Couldn't live without this. I only wish I found it earlier.
* [Synx](https://github.com/venmo/synx) - Organize your project into a directory structure of how it looks in Xcode.
* [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/) - Various iOS tools including one to automatically take screenshots of different screens on every device, put screenshots into right device frames, setting up provisioning, etc.
* [Paintcode](http://www.paintcodeapp.com/) - Animate your drawings with code. Essentially you can move them or change colors. I haven't tried it, but it looks pretty cool.
* [GeoFire](https://www.firebase.com/blog/2014-06-23-geofire-two-point-oh.html) - A Firebase tool to help you query a set of items based on geographic location. Loads the data near a location to keep your apps lighter even with large datasets.

### Libraries
* [Medium Article](https://medium.com/app-coder-io/27-ios-open-source-libraries-to-skyrocket-your-development-301b67d3124c#.kwidnyt8m) - This article is amazing and has some of the best libraries you might need for your apps. Even if you think you don't need these libraries, you will after reading this.
* [Awesome Swift](https://github.com/matteocrippa/awesome-swift#alert) - Your one and only source for finding the best libraries in existence for every one of your library needs. However, there are a few in the medium article not mentioned on here.

### Icons
* [Icons8](https://icons8.com/web-app/category/ios7/Very-Basic) - A huge set of icons that you can use for tab bar and within your app. You have to pay for larger icons, but generally screenshots of the icon previews has worked for me.
* [Logos](http://instantlogosearch.com/?q=faceb) - Logos of all companies and buttons in PNG and SVG format.

### Designs
* [Design Code](https://designcode.io/) - I haven't explored this much, but it looks interesting.
* [UI Kit](http://mercury.io/blog/free-ios-9-3-iphone-ui-kit-for-illustrator-and-sketch) - Free UIKit for Illustrator and Sketch.
